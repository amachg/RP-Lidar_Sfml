# Slamtec RPLIDAR Viewer, using SFML, for Windows	or	Linux

 2D LIDAR scan-data display, using C++, SFML graphic, built by cmake.

This code reads point-cloud data from an RPLIDAR Device and displays the output on an SFML display window in realtime.
Also displayed are closest/farthest distance arrows, low/hight distance limits, the axes and the device.
The user can move the axes origin with the arrow keys and zoom with the mouse wheel.
I have avoided using STL (except once) in order to make it easy to migrate it to Arduino.

Requires: 
* Windows	or	Linux
* Slamtec RPLIDAR SDK: https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_sdk
* CMake build system 
* SFML graphic framework (auto installed by cmake)

Tested with: 
* RPLIDAR model: A1M8 (Firmware ver: 1.29)
* Slamtec RPLIDAR SDK v2
* CMake v3.26 ( as part of Visual-Studio-2023 - Windows 11 )
* SFML v2.6

RPLIDAR A1M8 performs a 360Â° scan, from 15 cm to 12 m,
Sample Rate (in KiloSamples per second): 2, 4, 8 (default in Firmware ver: 1.29)
Scan Rate 7.5Hz (450 RPM or 1053 samples per round), can possibly be adjusted 2-10 Hz, by motor PWM signal
